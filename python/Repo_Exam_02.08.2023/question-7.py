# 1- Creat a function named calculate_rectangle_area thet takes the with and height of a rectangle as parameters and returns its area.
# 2- Demonstrate the usage of this function by calculating the area of a rectangle width=46 and height=76

def calculate_rectangle_area(width, height):
    print(width * height)

calculate_rectangle_area(46, 76)
